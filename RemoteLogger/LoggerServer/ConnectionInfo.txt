System.Security.Authentication.AuthenticationException: The remote certificate is invalid according to the validation procedure: RemoteCertificateNameMismatch

The error you're encountering is due to the SSL certificate validation process. 
When you use 127.0.0.1, the certificate's common name (CN) or subject alternative name (SAN)
 does not match the IP address, leading to a RemoteCertificateNameMismatch error.

To resolve this, you have a couple of options:

1.Update the Certificate: Ensure that the SSL certificate includes 127.0.0.1 as a SAN.
 This can be done when generating the certificate. Here's an example of how you might
 generate a self-signed certificate with 127.0.0.1 included:

 openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout mycert.key -out mycert.crt -subj "/CN=127.0.0.1" -addext "subjectAltName=IP:127.0.0.1"
 ```

2. Disable Certificate Validation (for Development Only):
 If you're in a development environment and can afford to bypass SSL validation, you can disable it.
 However, this is not recommended for production. Here's how you might do it in C#:

 using Grpc.Net.Client;
 using System;
 using System.Net.Http;
 using System.Net.Security;
 using System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates;

 class Program
 {
     static void Main()
     {
         var handler = new HttpClientHandler();
         handler.ServerCertificateCustomValidationCallback = HttpClientHandler.DangerousAcceptAnyServerCertificateValidator;

         var httpClient = new HttpClient(handler);
         var channel = GrpcChannel.ForAddress("https://127.0.0.1:5001", new GrpcChannelOptions { HttpClient = httpClient });

         var client = new YourGrpcService.YourGrpcServiceClient(channel);
         var response = client.YourMethod(new YourRequest());

         Console.WriteLine("Response: " + response.Message);
     }
 }
 ```

Use localhost: Since localhost works without issues, you can continue using it for local development. 
The certificate likely includes localhost as a valid name, which is why it passes validation.

-------------------------
Switch off certificate checking

Configure the gRPC client to allow unencrypted HTTP/2:

 using Grpc.Net.Client;
 using System;

 class Program
 {
     static void Main()
     {
         // Enable support for unencrypted HTTP/2
         AppContext.SetSwitch("System.Net.Http.SocketsHttpHandler.Http2UnencryptedSupport", true);

         // Create a channel to the server
         var channel = GrpcChannel.ForAddress("http://127.0.0.1:5000");

         // Create a client for your gRPC service
         var client = new YourGrpcService.YourGrpcServiceClient(channel);

         // Call a method on the client
         var response = client.YourMethod(new YourRequest());

         Console.WriteLine("Response: " + response.Message);
     }
 }
 ```
 Disable SSL certificate validation:
  using Grpc.Net.Client;
 using System;
 using System.Net.Http;

 class Program
 {
     static void Main()
     {
         var handler = new HttpClientHandler();
         handler.ServerCertificateCustomValidationCallback = HttpClientHandler.DangerousAcceptAnyServerCertificateValidator;

         var httpClient = new HttpClient(handler);
         var channel = GrpcChannel.ForAddress("https://127.0.0.1:5001", new GrpcChannelOptions { HttpClient = httpClient });

         var client = new YourGrpcService.YourGrpcServiceClient(channel);
         var response = client.YourMethod(new YourRequest());

         Console.WriteLine("Response: " + response.Message);
     }
 }
 ```

 Config appsettings URL
 - Server 
 To configure your gRPC server to run on a remote PC, you need to set the URL in the appsettings.json file to the IP address 
 or hostname of the remote server along with the port number. Here's an example of how you might do this:
 
 {
  "Kestrel": {
    "Endpoints": {
      "Http": {
        "Url": "http://0.0.0.0:5000",
        "Protocols": "Http1AndHttp2"
      },
      "gRPC": {
        "Url": "http://0.0.0.0:5001",
        "Protocols": "Http2"
      }
    }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*"
}

In this example:
 - 0.0.0.0 allows the server to listen on all network interfaces, making it accessible from remote PCs.
 - 5001 is the port for gRPC communication.
 
 If you want to specify a particular IP address, replace 0.0.0.0 with the actual IP address of the remote server:
 (but this requires firewall config)

{
  "Kestrel": {
    "Endpoints": {
      "Http": {
        "Url": "http://192.168.1.100:5000",
        "Protocols": "Http1AndHttp2"
      },
      "gRPC": {
        "Url": "http://192.168.1.100:5001",
        "Protocols": "Http2"
      }
    }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*"
}
--------------------------------------------
The "AllowedHosts": "*" setting in the appsettings.json file specifies which hosts are allowed to access your application. 
The asterisk (*) is a wildcard character that means any host is allowed.

Here's a bit more detail:

Wildcard (*): Allows requests from any host. This is useful during development or when you want to accept requests from multiple domains.
Specific Hosts: You can also specify particular hosts by listing them, separated by semicolons.
For example, "AllowedHosts": "example.com;anotherdomain.com" would restrict access to only those domains.
Using "AllowedHosts": "*" is convenient for development, but in a production environment, it's generally better to specify
the allowed hosts to enhance security.

In the context of web applications, the "host" refers to the domain name or IP address where your application is running. 
For example, if your application is
accessible at http://example.com, then example.com is the host. Similarly, if your application is running on a server 
with the IP address 192.168.1.100, then 192.168.1.100 is the host.

The "AllowedHosts" setting in appsettings.json specifies which hosts are permitted to make requests to your application.
This helps control access and can be used to prevent unauthorized domains from interacting with your server.
