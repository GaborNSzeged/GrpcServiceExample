 - AsyncUnaryCall<T> -> inside there is a Task<T>, whic is the ResponseAsync
   
    Server sends the data in stream
 - AsyncServerStreamingCall<T> -> inside there is an ISyncStreamreader<T>, which is the ResponseStream
 
   Client send the data to server in stream
 - AsyncClientStreamingCall -> RequestStream.WriteAsync
   Important to close complete the steam an wait for the response, even if it is an Empty

   await call3.ResponseAsync;
